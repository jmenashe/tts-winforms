Text-to-Speech application. This app is Free to use, offline application. Build on top of Windows Form, uses Windows installed Synthesis. 
You choose one of the available voices, and make it read text, download as `.wav` file on your Desktop, under `Audio Files` folder.

### SSML
Additionally it fully supports SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language, [Read docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/skills/speech-synthesis-markup-language))

You can select text, and choose your SSML from right box. Example use cases: pause for certain period, increase/decrease volume, change reading rate and etc. Selection box does not include all possibilities. For more SSML options, please refer to [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/skills/speech-synthesis-markup-language)

> Note: If text is has incorrect use of SSML, then it will not read at all.


### Basic/Advaanced mode
By default application is in **Advanced mode**, which supports SSML, and shows options. Whereas switching to **Basic mode** will disable reading SSMLs and will read as plain text. Use Basic mode for less overhead and clear view.


### Isolate text
Your text may get too long to test certain sentences, and you do not want to wait for that sentence to be read. To solve this issue, comes **Isolate text**. Select text you want to be read, then click on Isolate text button. It will hide other texts and show only selected text, then you can change/play/download text. 

> Note: all changes made to text in Isolated mode, will be discarded after switch back
